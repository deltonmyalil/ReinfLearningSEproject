Ad Optimization using Reinforcement Learning

Here, a datafile is used to simulate the user click data.
Once the project is deployed alongise a website, actual user clicks can be used for learning.
Ads_CTR_Optimisation.csv is the stub that acts as user clicks.
numpy, pandas, matplotlib, math packages have to be installed in the venv for this to work.
On deployment, remove the visualization code.
